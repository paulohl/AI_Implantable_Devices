2. The internals of modern CIEDs (pacemakers/ICDs/CRT devices) are proprietary.
3. Citing/referencing the rich body of peer-review, consensus statements, regulatory guidance, and vendor technical

# Pacemakers: “AI-ready” from the inside 
_____________

## What “AI-ready” inside a pacemaker actually means (today)


### **Safe partitioning (hard rule)**:

* **Domain A — Therapy & sensing (in-can, real-time)**: <br> analog front-end for intracardiac sensing, pacing output stage, timing/control, watchdogs, sealed firmware; deterministic and power-budgeted. Think ultra-low-power MCU/ASIC + RTOS, IEC 62304 Class C. Classic block diagrams remain accurate (sensing → filtering/ADC → microcontroller → pulse generator → memory/power/telemetry). [jcomputers.us](https://www.jcomputers.us/vol3/jcp0308-06.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)    [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4757-5683-8_1.pdf?pdf=inline+link&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Domain B — In-can comms & very small inference**: authenticated telemetry (MICS/MedRadio 402–405 MHz; sometimes BLE) and only tiny, verifiable algorithms (e.g., morphology features, simple anomaly thresholds). Anything compute-hungry stays out of the can due to battery and validation constraints. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10385670/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [BioMed Central](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12938-024-01277-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Domain C — External relay + cloud (“central intelligence”)**: phone or bedside hub relays device data; the cloud runs heavy ML for triage, prediction, cohort analytics, and fleet risk. This is how current AI features ship in practice (e.g., Medtronic AccuRhythm AI runs in the CareLink cloud). [Medtronic](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/products/cardiac-rhythm/technologies/accurhythm-ai-algorithms.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **Connectivity realities (important for diagrams)**:
* Implants historically talk over **MICS/MedRadio** because tissue attenuation and power budgets make Wi-Fi/5G in-can impractical. BLE is now common for patient-app pairing; full IP stacks live in the phone/hub. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10385670/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  [BioMed Central](https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-07-06-Abbott-Receives-FDA-Approval-for-New-Heart-Rhythm-Devices-Featuring-Bluetooth-Connectivity-and-Continuous-Remote-Monitoring?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Concrete examples: Medtronic **BlueSync** (BLE → MyCareLink app/network); Abbott **Gallant** ICD/CRT-D (Bluetooth → myMerlinPulse). Biotronik and Boston Scientific rely on home communicators (cellular) tied to vendor clouds. [Medtronic](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/products/cardiac-rhythm/technologies/bluesync-technology.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)   [Abbott MediaRoom](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/products/cardiac-rhythm/technologies/bluesync-technology.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  [Biotronik](https://www.biotronik.com/en-us/products/cardiac-rhythm-management/remote-patient-monitoring-systems/biotronik-home-monitoring?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **What already exists (state of the practice)**:
* **Remote monitoring is standard of care** for CIEDs and improves outcomes; large networks (LATITUDE, Merlin, CareLink) run at scale. [Heart Rhythm Journal](https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271%2823%2902011-8/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Cloud AI** today: Medtronic **AccuRhythm** AI (deep learning) filters false AF/pause alerts on LINQ II ICMs (≈90%+ false-alert reduction in studies) and is applied in the cloud after data transmission. Boston Scientific **HeartLogic** (multi-sensor index in ICD/CRT-D) predicts impending HF decompensation weeks in advance and is surfaced through LATITUDE. These are the best current exemplars for your “central intelligence” layer.

## What to put inside the can vs. outside
* **Inside (feasible now)**: low-power feature extraction, rule-based discriminators, lightweight anomaly scoring that’s bounded and testable; secure telemetry; cryptographically signed update mechanism (rarely used for in-can algorithms; more for device maintenance). Leadless designs tighten the power budget further. [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.202100614?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Outside**: anything adaptive/learning (cloud retraining, cohort drift monitoring, explainability reports), digital twins, risk stratification, clinic workload orchestration, policy-driven alerting. That’s how AccuRhythm and HeartLogic are operationalized today.

## Regulatory & security guardrails (important for references and citations)
* **FDA Cybersecurity (Premarket) — Final guidance (updated June 2025)** sets expectations for threat modeling, SBOM, secure updates, incident response, and labeling.

## Proposed Architecture (macro view)
1. **Implant (Domain A/B)**:
<br> sensing AFE → ADC → safety-certified MCU/ASIC (hard-real-time pacing/arrhythmia logic) → pulse generator → secure storage (logs/params) → telemetry transceiver (MICS ± BLE) → crypto/auth & watchdogs. </br> [jcomputers.us](https://www.jcomputers.us/vol3/jcp0308-06.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Patient relay**:
<br> smartphone app (BLE) or bedside communicator (cellular) doing secure store-and-forward, retries, and local privacy controls. </br> [Medtronic](https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/products/cardiac-rhythm/technologies/bluesync-technology.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)       [Boston Scientific](https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/patients-caregivers/treatments-conditions/remote-monitoring-system.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Cloud back office**:

## Practical constraints to call out
* **Power budget dominates** (battery life targets 10–15 yrs; leadless devices even tighter). Any in-can ML must be tiny, fixed, and formally verifiable.

* **RF & antenna physics** favor MICS/MedRadio for in-body links; Wi-Fi/5G belong in the external relay. [PMC](
* **Field evidence favors the relay-and-cloud pattern** for AI gains (false-alert reduction, HF prediction). [Medtronic](    [Boston Scientific](

### So: how far can we “dissect” advanced pacemakers?
Deep enough to build credible, **publishable** AI architectures that align with what’s on the market and what regulators expect—without needing proprietary schematics. We can document the canonical in-can blocks and show precisely which AI functions live where (and why), then back every arrow with an FDA or peer-review citation. That’s exactly how Medtronic and Boston Scientific deliver AI benefits today: tiny, bounded logic inside; **learning and heavy inference outside**.
