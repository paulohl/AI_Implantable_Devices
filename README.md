# Pacemakers: “AI-ready” from the inside 


## What “AI-ready” inside a pacemaker actually means (today)

**Safe partitioning (hard rule)**:

* **Domain A — Therapy & sensing (in-can, real-time)**: analog front-end for intracardiac sensing, pacing output stage, timing/control, watchdogs, sealed firmware; deterministic and power-budgeted. Think ultra-low-power MCU/ASIC + RTOS, IEC 62304 Class C. Classic block diagrams remain accurate (sensing → filtering/ADC → microcontroller → pulse generator → memory/power/telemetry). jcomputers.usSpringerLink
	• Domain B — In-can comms & very small inference: authenticated telemetry (MICS/MedRadio 402–405 MHz; sometimes BLE) and only tiny, verifiable algorithms (e.g., morphology features, simple anomaly thresholds). Anything compute-hungry stays out of the can due to battery and validation constraints. PMCBioMed Central
	• Domain C — External relay + cloud (“central intelligence”): phone or bedside hub relays device data; the cloud runs heavy ML for triage, prediction, cohort analytics, and fleet risk. This is how current AI features ship in practice (e.g., Medtronic AccuRhythm AI runs in the CareLink cloud). Medtronic

Connectivity realities (important for your diagrams):
	• Implants historically talk over MICS/MedRadio because tissue attenuation and power budgets make Wi-Fi/5G in-can impractical. BLE is now common for patient-app pairing; full IP stacks live in the phone/hub. PMCBioMed Central
	• Concrete examples: Medtronic BlueSync (BLE → MyCareLink app/network); Abbott Gallant ICD/CRT-D (Bluetooth → myMerlinPulse). Biotronik and Boston Scientific rely on home communicators (cellular) tied to vendor clouds. Medtronic+1Abbott MediaRoombiotronik.com+1

What already exists (state of the practice):
	• Remote monitoring is standard of care for CIEDs and improves outcomes; large networks (LATITUDE, Merlin, CareLink) run at scale. Heart Rhythm Journal
	• Cloud AI today: Medtronic AccuRhythm AI (deep learning) filters false AF/pause alerts on LINQ II ICMs (≈90%+ false-alert reduction in studies) and is applied in the cloud after data transmission. Boston Scientific HeartLogic (multi-sensor index in ICD/CRT-D) predicts impending HF decompensation weeks in advance and is surfaced through LATITUDE. These are the best current exemplars for your “central intelligence” layer. MedtronicPMCMedtronic Newswww.bostonscientific.comOnline JCF

What to put inside the can vs. outside
	• Inside (feasible now): low-power feature extraction, rule-based discriminators, lightweight anomaly scoring that’s bounded and testable; secure telemetry; cryptographically signed update mechanism (rarely used for in-can algorithms; more for device maintenance). Leadless designs tighten the power budget further. Wiley Online Library+1
	• Outside: anything adaptive/learning (cloud retraining, cohort drift monitoring, explainability reports), digital twins, risk stratification, clinic workload orchestration, policy-driven alerting. That’s how AccuRhythm and HeartLogic are operationalized today. Medtronicwww.bostonscientific.com

Regulatory & security guardrails you’ll want to cite
	• FDA Cybersecurity (Premarket) — Final guidance (updated June 2025) sets expectations for threat modeling, SBOM, secure updates, incident response, and labeling. Use this to justify your end-to-end security architecture and update pipeline. U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationFederal RegisterEmergo by UL
	• FDA PCCP (Predetermined Change Control Plans) for AI-enabled devices — Finalized Dec 2024, updated Aug 2025 page. Lets you pre-authorize future model changes (great for your cloud AI and for any bounded in-can tweaks). Ropes & GrayMcDermott+U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	• Closed-loop control considerations (for any automated therapy logic you propose) + society consensus that remote monitoring is beneficial. U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationHeart Rhythm Journal
	• Why security matters (real events): Abbott/St. Jude 2017 firmware recall to mitigate cyber vulns; Medtronic Conexus RF telemetry vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-6538). These make a strong case for defense-in-depth, authenticated telemetry, and no “open” radios in-can. ASAAmerican College of CardiologyCISA

Architecture you can publish (macro view)
	1. Implant (Domain A/B):
sensing AFE → ADC → safety-certified MCU/ASIC (hard-real-time pacing/arrhythmia logic) → pulse generator → secure storage (logs/params) → telemetry transceiver (MICS ± BLE) → crypto/auth & watchdogs. jcomputers.us
	2. Patient relay: smartphone app (BLE) or bedside communicator (cellular) doing secure store-and-forward, retries, and local privacy controls. Medtronicwww.bostonscientific.com
	3. Cloud back office: ingestion (CareLink/Merlin/LATITUDE-like), device fleet IAM, SBOM tracking, PCCP-governed model registry, inference services (AccuRhythm/HeartLogic-style), clinician consoles, and FHIR-based EHR hooks. Medtronicwww.bostonscientific.com

Practical constraints you should call out in any new paper
	• Power budget dominates (battery life targets 10–15 yrs; leadless devices even tighter). Any in-can ML must be tiny, fixed, and formally verifiable. Cleveland ClinicWiley Online Library
	• RF & antenna physics favor MICS/MedRadio for in-body links; Wi-Fi/5G belong in the external relay. PMC
	• Field evidence favors the relay-and-cloud pattern for AI gains (false-alert reduction, HF prediction). Medtronicwww.bostonscientific.com

So—how far can we “dissect” advanced pacemakers?
Deep enough to build credible, publishable AI architectures that align with what’s on the market and what regulators expect—without needing proprietary schematics. We can document the canonical in-can blocks and show precisely which AI functions live where (and why), then back every arrow with an FDA or peer-review citation. That’s exactly how Medtronic and Boston Scientific deliver AI benefits today: tiny, bounded logic inside; learning and heavy inference outside. Medtronicwww.bostonscientific.com

If you want, I can draft a one-page macro diagram (your minimalist style) that mirrors the partitioning above and annotates each interface (MICS/BLE → app → cloud ML → clinician console), with footnote citations matching these sources.
