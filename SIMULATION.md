# Synthetic PQRST generation (configurable arrhythmias)

__________

### Summary:
- Day-to-day cardiologists (clinically) use commercial ECG simulators or ECGSYN-like mathematical generators for testing.
- Researchers/engineers use biophysical simulators (openCARP, CHASTE, etc.) when they want real tissue-level fidelity.
- Device companies/regulators use virtual heart models for pacing therapy validation.

______________

When cardiologists (and biomedical engineers) simulate PRT (P-wave, R-wave, T-wave) morphology, they typically don‚Äôt use a single ‚Äúblack box‚Äù tool, but rely on a few families of methods, depending on purpose:

üîπ **1. Clinical / Educational ECG Simulators**

- **Commercial ECG simulators** (Fluke ProSim, Symbio, etc.) are used in hospitals to test monitors, pacemakers, ICDs, and training systems. These can generate adjustable PRT complexes, intervals, and rhythms.

- They don‚Äôt simulate biophysics deeply ‚Äî they output ‚Äúplausible ECG waveforms‚Äù based on programmable templates.

üîπ **2. Mathematical / Computational Signal Models**

- **Dynamical models**: McSharry et al. (2003) introduced a differential equation‚Äìbased synthetic ECG generator, where P, QRS, and T are represented by Gaussian functions positioned around a limit cycle. This is still widely used for arrhythmia/HRV research because you can tweak P, R, T amplitudes and timings.

- **Open-source implementations**: Python libraries like NeuroKit2, MATLAB toolboxes, or the ‚ÄúECGSYN‚Äù generator allow parametric control of PRT morphology.

üîπ **3. Biophysical Heart Models (Digital Twins)**

- **Electrophysiology simulators** (e.g., openCARP, CHASTE, Cardioid from LLNL, Alya Red) simulate propagation of action potentials across atrial/ventricular tissue using reaction‚Äìdiffusion PDEs. These can generate realistic PRT waveforms as a byproduct of cellular/multicellular modeling.

- Used in academic research and increasingly in ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù studies. Computationally heavy ‚Äî not real-time.

üîπ **4. Pacemaker/Device Simulation Environments**

Device companies and some labs use virtual heart models where pacing pulses (atrial/ventricular) are injected and resulting PRT complexes simulated. For example:

- *Electrophysiology simulators* integrated into Medtronic or Boston Scientific test platforms.

- FDA‚Äôs **Virtual Heart Model (VHM)** initiative, used for regulatory science in pacing/arrhythmia safety.

Below, a complete Python simulator for a standard PQRST waveform.  
It builds beats as a sum of Gaussians (P, Q, R, S, T), adds baseline wander, optional mains interference, and beat-to-beat variability:

 **minimal renderng**, must add presets for:   
 * common scenarios (LBBB/RBBB morphology, LVH, ST elevation/depression, atrial flutter/fib with irregular RR, PVC bigeminy).
 * export the plot as a small pip-style module to drop into notebooks and simulation pipelines.
